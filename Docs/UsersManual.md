## 1 Introduction

Before the telescope can be used to position on celestial objects and track them, first it needs to be calibrated in it's neutral state. The neutral state is the state in which the telescope reads on all position sensors "zero" and can be used

## 3 Positioning

### 3.1 North

It is important as the tripod is going to be positioned that the telescope always faces north in it's neutral state. Make sure to grap a physical compass or a compass app on your phone to make sure the telescope with it's mount is facing north. This is important for that the circle is proportionate to the celestial equator.

### 3.2 Groundlevel

Most ground is natural and not as flat as most people hope to be. But because to have a good rotation circle that is proportionate a flat floor is mandatory to stand on. To fix this

## 4 Power

## 4.1 Wall power

As the EQ mount required a lot of power it is adviced to plug the telescope onto wallpower if possible. The connector of the telescope is a XT60 connector for 12v of power. Use a transformator to convert 230/120 volts of power to 12 volts of power.

## 4.2 Mobile power

Batteries can be used to power the telescope, because a XT60 connector is used to connect power to the telescope. It is important to note that the power requirements are 12V and at least 6 amps of power. 


## 5 Calibrating

### 5.1 Autocalibrating sensors

When the telescope is first booted up, all positioning sensors are calibrated at "zero". This is important
